Okay, let's break down the topic of using big decimal numbers (specifically likely referencing `BigDecimal` implementations) in D and Lisp.

**Understanding the Problem: `BigDecimal`s and Why They Matter**

* **Floating-Point Limitations:** Standard floating-point types (like `float` or `double` in C/C++/D and their equivalents in Lisp) use a binary representation. This means they can only represent numbers that are sums of powers of 2 accurately. Many decimal numbers (like 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) cannot be represented *exactly*. This leads to rounding errors that can accumulate and cause problems in financial calculations, scientific simulations where precision is paramount, and any situation where you need to be absolutely certain about the digits after the decimal point.

* **`BigDecimal` to the Rescue:**  A `BigDecimal` (or arbitrary-precision decimal) stores a number as a series of digits, typically in base 10 (or a power of 10). This allows for exact representation of decimal numbers and avoids the rounding errors inherent in floating-point types.  `BigDecimal` libraries typically allow you to specify the precision (the number of digits after the decimal point) and the rounding mode.

**D Language and `BigDecimal`**

1. **No Built-in `BigDecimal`:** The D language standard library (`Phobos`) does *not* have a built-in `BigDecimal` type.

2. **Available Libraries:**  You'll need to use an external library. Here are some options:

   * **`bdl.bigdecimal` (Probably the most popular):** This library is part of the BDL (Brave Digital Library) and is a common choice. You can find it through DUB (the D package manager).

     ```d
     // dub.sdl (add this to your dependencies)
     // dependency "bdl:bigdecimal" version="~>1.0.0" // (Use the latest version)

     import bdl.bigdecimal;
     import std.stdio;

     void main() {
         BigDecimal a = BigDecimal("0.1");
         BigDecimal b = BigDecimal("0.2");
         BigDecimal c = a + b;

         writeln(c); // Output: 0.3
     }
     ```

   * **GMP or MPFR wrappers:** GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library) and MPFR (GNU Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliably) are very powerful C libraries for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.  You can find D wrappers for these, although they might be a bit more complex to set up. These are generally preferred for *very* high-performance and high-precision calculations.

3. **Key Features of `bdl.bigdecimal`:**

   * **Arbitrary Precision:** You can specify the number of decimal places you need.
   * **Rounding Modes:**  It supports various rounding modes (e.g., `ROUND_UP`, `ROUND_DOWN`, `ROUND_HALF_UP`, `ROUND_HALF_EVEN`).
   * **Arithmetic Operations:** Overloaded operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) for easy calculations.
   * **String Conversion:**  Easy conversion from strings to `BigDecimal` and back.

**Lisp and `BigDecimal`**

Lisp (particularly Common Lisp) has excellent support for arbitrary-precision arithmetic built in.

1. **Built-in `rational` Type:** Lisp's `rational` type can represent fractions *exactly*.  This is a core feature.  While not *exactly* a `BigDecimal`, it solves a very similar problem for representing decimal numbers accurately as fractions.

   ```lisp
   ;; Example with rationals
   (/ 1 10)  ; Represents 1/10 or 0.1 exactly
   (+ (/ 1 10) (/ 2 10)) ; Represents 3/10 or 0.3 exactly
   ```

2. **`bignum` (Integer):** Lisp automatically switches to using `bignum` integers when standard integer types overflow.  This is built-in and seamless.

3. **`float` with Adjustable Precision (Sort Of):** Lisp floats are generally IEEE 754 floating point numbers (like `double` in C/C++/D).  The Common Lisp standard specifies `short-float`, `single-float`, `double-float`, and `long-float` with varying precision levels.  However, for *true* arbitrary-precision decimal, you typically rely on rational numbers or external libraries.

4. **Arbitrary-Precision Floating Point Libraries:** While not strictly necessary due to `rational` numbers, libraries that provide `BigDecimal` or arbitrary-precision floating-point are available for Common Lisp if you need more control over rounding and formatting.  Examples:

   * **`float` package:**  Some Common Lisp implementations might provide extensions or libraries to better control the precision of floats or provide arbitrary precision floats. Check your specific implementation's documentation (e.g., SBCL, CLISP).
   * **GMP Wrappers:**  As with D, you can use wrappers for GMP in Lisp if you need the absolute best performance for arbitrary-precision calculations.  Cl-gmp is an example of such a wrapper.

**Example in Common Lisp (using `rational`):**

```lisp
(defun bigdecimal-add (num1 num2)
  (+ num1 num2))

(let ((a (/ 1 10))  ; 0.1
      (b (/ 2 10)))  ; 0.2
  (format t "~A~%" (bigdecimal-add a b))) ; Output: 3/10
```

**Key Differences and Considerations:**

* **Built-in vs. Library:** Lisp has built-in rational numbers that effectively address many of the same problems that `BigDecimal` solves. D requires an external library.
* **Fractions vs. Decimal Representation:** Lisp's `rational` numbers represent values as fractions (numerator/denominator). A true `BigDecimal` stores the number as a sequence of decimal digits, which can be preferable for some applications (especially when formatting and presentation are important).
* **Performance:** Both languages can achieve good performance. If performance is critical, GMP wrappers can be a good choice in either language.  However, the overhead of arbitrary-precision arithmetic is always higher than native floating-point.  Consider if you truly *need* the extra precision.  If you don't, standard `double` (or equivalent) may be sufficient.
* **Ease of Use:** `bdl.bigdecimal` in D is quite easy to use due to its operator overloading.  Lisp's `rational` types are also straightforward to work with.

**In Summary:**

* **D:** Use `bdl.bigdecimal` (or a GMP/MPFR wrapper) when you need `BigDecimal` functionality.
* **Lisp:** Start by using `rational` numbers. If you have very specific requirements for decimal representation, rounding, or performance, then explore GMP wrappers or Lisp-specific libraries for arbitrary-precision floating-point.

Choose the right tool for the job!  Consider the following:

* **Accuracy Requirements:** How much precision do you *really* need?
* **Performance Constraints:** How fast must the calculations be?
* **Ease of Use:** How easy is it to integrate the library or feature into your code?
* **Available Libraries:** What libraries are readily available and well-maintained in your chosen language?
